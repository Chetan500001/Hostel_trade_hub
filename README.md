# Hostel Trade Hub

Hostel Trade Hub is a mobile application aimed at helping hostel students buy, sell, and donate items within their college or hostel community. The platform creates a safe, local marketplace that saves time, cuts costs, and encourages reuse among students.

## Problem Statement

Hostel students often struggle to buy or sell used items like books, electronics, and everyday products. They also have trouble donating items they no longer need. Existing online marketplaces are too large, unverified, and not specific to hostels. Hostel Trade Hub addresses this issue by offering a trusted, campus-level trading platform.
